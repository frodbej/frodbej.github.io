This project focuses on the implementation of a simple yet effective **2D protein folding** algorithm using the Simulated Annealing optimization technique. In the developed spatial model, each protein is encoded as a dictionary with coordinates as keys and amino acids as values. The scoring function, which integrates hydrophobicity and adjacent position availability, is the central component. The objective is to minimize the overall score of the protein structure, indicating a favorable arrangement of hydrophilic amino acids exposed to the aqueous medium.

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/frodbej/2d-protein-folding).
