This project aims to explore the **drug discovery** field employing **machine learning techniques**. The chosen target of the project is **BRAF** *(B-Raf proto-oncogene)*, a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in the MAPK signalling pathway and that is involved in various **cancers**, such as melanomas and colorectal cancers.

Inhibition of BRAF represents a strategy to disrupt the hyperactive MAPK signaling cascade and block the growth of cancer cells presenting BRAF mutations. In fact, several **BRAF inhibitors** have been investigated in preclinical and clinical settings, showcasing promising anti-tumor activities.

For this reason, the application of machine learning techniques, such as **regression models**, for BRAF-targeted drug discovery poses an interesting challenge. Specifically, regression models will be employed to predict the **bioactivity of different molecules against BRAF**. The utilization of PubChem fingerprints and IC50 values will serve as the basis for developing the predictive model.
