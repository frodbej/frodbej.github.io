This is a reproduction of the RNA-Seq data analysis performed by [Himes et al.](10.1371/journal.pone.0099625) in order to identify *transcriptional changes* in Human Airway Smooth Muscle (HASM) due to asthma treatment with **dexamethasone**.

Tasks performed:
- RNA-Seq data prefiltering and exploration.
- Differential analysis using DESeq2.
- Visualization of differentially expressed genes through volcano plots and heatmaps.
- GO enrichment analysis.
