Implementation and exploration of global and local sequence alignment algorithms, focusing on the widely used **Needleman-Wunsch** and **Smith-Waterman** algorithms. The primary objective of this project was to implement, analyze, and compare these algorithms.

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, known for its ability to align entire sequences, was implemented to determine optimal **global alignments**. The Smith-Waterman algorithm, designed for **local sequence alignment**, was employed to identify local similarities and patterns within sequences.

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/frodbej/sequence-alignment-algorithms).
